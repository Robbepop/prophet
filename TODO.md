TODO-LIST
=========

This is the list of things that are planned for the next updates:

 - Write blog post about the type state pattern and publish new version.
 - Implement some unit tests, testing the internals of layers.
 - Generic float type support (e.g. for future `f16`, `f32`, `f64`, `f128`)
