PROPHET
=======

A convolutional neural net implementation written in Rust with a focus on performance.


Usage
-----

 - pull this project into your workspace
 - build and run with cargo

This project is not (yet) supported on crates.io.

Future Plans (in no specific order)
-----------------------------------
 
 - implement neural net generically for ```num::Float``` types
 - add better abstractions and features
 - improve code documentation
 - add usage examples
 - improve test code coverage
 - implement a GPGPU implementation for large layers
 - improve error handling: less panics, more results
