PROPHET
=======

A neural net implementation written in Rust with a focus on cache-efficiency and sequential performance.

Take a look into the [documentation](https://docs.rs/prophet) to get to know how to use it!

Link to [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/prophet).

Usage
-----

 - pull this project into your workspace
 - build and run with cargo


Future Plans (in no specific order)
-----------------------------------

 - convolutional neural network implementation
 - implement neural net generically for ```num::Float``` types
 - improve error handling: less panics, more results
 - enhance interfaces with stronger type safety
 - add usage examples and benchmarks
 - increase test code coverage
 - parallel implementation for large layers
