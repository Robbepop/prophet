TODO-LIST
=========

This is the list of things that are planned for the next updates:

 - Improved layer architecture to support convolutional layers.
 - Improved error handling: Less panics, more Results!
 - Generic float type support (e.g. for future `f16`, `f32`, `f64`, `f128`)
 - Parallelization based on Rayon or Volkano.
