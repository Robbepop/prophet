TODO-LIST
=========

This is the list of spontaneous things that are planned for the next update:

 - Parallelization based on Rayon or Volkano.
 - Improved layer architecture to support convolutional layers.
 - Generic float type support (e.g. for future `f16`, `f32`, `f64`, `f128`)
 - Rewrite NeuralNetwork so that you cannot let it predict data before it hasn't learned anything.
 - Serialization and deserialization for neural networks via Serde.
 - Improved error handling: Less panics, more Results!
